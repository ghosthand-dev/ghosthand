# Device access

- `.passcode` is stale. Never read, print, upload, or commit its contents. Use only a user-confirmed Sigillo `IPHONE_PASSCODE` if unlocking is needed; never print secrets or put them in command arguments.
- Take a lease first: `.build/debug/ghosthand acquire --label <session id> --reason "<task>"` prints a short ID, e.g. `42`. Pass `-l 42` explicitly to every device command, including `release`. Tool-call environments may not persist; do not rely on an exported `GHOSTHAND_LEASE`.
- Always pass `--reason` with your task. If another session holds it, acquire fails and shows its reason and last command: give up or tell the user, or run `ghosthand wait --reason "<task>" --timeout 600`. Never `--force`. The label is only display text; it does not resume a lease. Leave the phone unlocked and run `ghosthand release -l 42` when done.
- Do not delete or restore `state.db`: its persistent counter prevents old lease IDs from controlling new leases. Lease numbers are coordination IDs, not remote authentication; TCP requires the daemon bearer token.
- For secret text, pipe directly to `ghosthand type -l 42 --stdin`. One final LF or CRLF is removed; other whitespace is preserved. Validate focus first, and never repeat input automatically after a verification timeout.
- Check the iPhone with `ghosthand list` before input. A wrong passcode is not retried because failed attempts count toward lockout.

# CLI help is the agent manual

Agents learn ghosthand from `ghosthand --help` and `ghosthand <command> --help` before they read the README. So every rule an agent needs to use a command correctly goes into the CLI help, in `Sources/ghosthand/main.swift`:

- `description`: one line, what the command does. Shown in the root command list.
- `details`: usage notes and rules, shown only by `<command> --help`: what the output means, what to do on common errors, limits found in tests (for example "Home Screen labels do not open apps").
- `agentLoopHelp`: the rules for every command (coordinate space, `--screenshot` after actions, leave the phone unlocked). Shown by `ghosthand --help`.

When you find a new limit or a rule while testing on a real iPhone, add it to the matching command's `details` first, then to the README if a human needs it too. Keep help text short and concrete: say what to do, not only what went wrong.

# Two front ends: CLI and MCP

The daemon has two thin front ends over the same `Controller` calls. Keep them equal:

```
ghosthand CLI (main.swift) ──HTTP /v1/... (api.swift, openapi.yaml)──────────────────┐
                                                                                     ├──> Controller
MCP client ──stdio──> ghosthand mcp (MCPStdio) ──POST /mcp (MCPServer, mcp.swift)────┘
```

MCP is stdio only: `ghosthand mcp` relays each stdin line to the daemon over the unix socket (or `--url` for a remote daemon). The protocol and the tools live in the daemon.

- **Logic goes in the daemon**, never in a front end. If the CLI or a tool needs OCR, polling, retries or matching, add it to `Controller` and expose it on the HTTP route, so both front ends share it.
- **One manual for both.** MCP tool descriptions and instructions are built from the CLI help (`mcpDocs()` in `main.swift`): `description`, `details`, option names, `examples`, `agentLoopHelp`. Write help text there, never a second copy in `mcp.swift`.
- **A new route or capability gets both.** Add the HTTP route (`openapi.yaml` + `api.swift`), the CLI command or flag (`main.swift`), and the MCP tool or argument (`tools` in `mcp.swift`) in the same change. A tool name is the CLI command name.
- **A new CLI flag needs its MCP argument:** add it to the tool's `properties`, and to `MCPDescription.arguments` (flag -> argument) or `MCPDescription.positionals`. Otherwise its examples are dropped from the tool description without an error.
- **`ghosthand mcp` never writes to stdout except JSON-RPC replies.** Stdout is the protocol channel: one stray line breaks the client's parser. Logs and errors go to stderr (`stderrLog`). `MCPStdio.run` points fd 1 at stderr and writes replies to a saved copy of stdout, so do not remove that, and never add `print` to code that runs in `ghosthand mcp`.
- **Check both:** `swift test` covers the MCP protocol and the description conversion. For a real check, pipe JSON-RPC lines into `ghosthand mcp` and check that every stdout line parses with `jq`, or run `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli ghosthand mcp --method tools/list`.

# Relative pointer (iOS 15)

Read `docs/relative-pointer.md` before changing relative pointer code: the acceleration table, the measurements, and the timing rules (150 ms after homing, 100 ms before a press).

# Scroll (HID wheel)

Read `docs/scroll.md` before changing `scroll`: why iOS drops the first 2 wheel reports (IOHIDScrollAccelerator), the lead-in, and the measured points per tick.

# Reference sources

Read these before guessing how iOS handles HID input:

- [IOHIDFamily](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/IOHIDFamily/tree/IOHIDFamily-1787.140.2) (Apple open source): how iOS turns HID reports into events: scroll acceleration, pointer, descriptor parsing.
- [iOS 18.2 decompiled system binaries](https://github.com/EthanArbuckle/iPhone17-1_18.2_22C152_Restore) (HID plugins under `System/Library/HIDPlugins`): check that iOS ships the same code as the open source.
- [egarl004/mirrordeck](https://github.com/egarl004/mirrordeck): same design as ghosthand (Mac as Bluetooth Classic HID, iPhone with AssistiveTouch). Descriptors, absolute + relative reports, wheel.
- [yoyicue/glassbox wheel notes](https://github.com/yoyicue/glassbox/blob/main/docs/reference/picokvm_ipad_wheel.md): HID wheel on iPad/iPhone over a USB gadget (PicoKVM).

To find code, search one unique function name or constant (`gh search code 'IOHIDScrollAccelerator'`), not sentences.

# Publishing to npm

`npm/` is the `ghosthand` npm package: one universal binary (arm64 + x86_64) as the bin.

- Bump `version` in `npm/package.json` and `ghosthandVersion` in `Sources/ghosthand/daemon.swift` together. The build fails if they differ.
- Publish with `cd npm && pnpm publish --no-git-checks`. Do not run `pnpm build` first: `prepublishOnly` cleans `dist` and runs the full build (about 3 min).
- The registry can take ~5 min before `npx ghosthand@<version>` resolves. Poll `curl -s https://registry.npmjs.org/ghosthand | jq '."dist-tags"'`; do not publish again.
- Build from the committed tree: `prepublishOnly` compiles whatever Swift code is in the working tree, including uncommitted changes from other sessions.
